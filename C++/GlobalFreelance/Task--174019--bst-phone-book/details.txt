Task Description:

Problem: A Simple program is needed to keep track phone numbers. 
This program should allow you to enter a contact name and find that 
contact’s phone number. When a contact is found, it is considered 
the current contact. The current contacts Phone number can be changed 
if needed. 

The Current contact may also be deleted. Names are considered Primary Key 
data in this structure and may not be duplicated or manipulated. 
Program should also allow you to print an alphabetical listing of 
contacts by “last name, first name”.

Design: 
An interactive menu should give the following options:
  1.	Find Contact
  2.	Display current contact
  3.	Add Contact
  4.	Delete Current Contact
  5.	Display Contact List
  6.	Quit.

Use a Binary Sorting Tree Data structure. Each node in the tree will be 
a contact object that holds the last name, the first name and the phone number 
of the contact. Additionally there are left and right pointers to additional contacts. 

The Address Book object will manage the tree (add, sort, read and delete nodes).
The find function will search for a last name first name combination, 
if found it will set the current pointer to that contact and return a true value.
Display Current will display the first and last name and the phone number of the current.

The sample (zip file) uses custom implementation of binary search tree. So please do the same.
